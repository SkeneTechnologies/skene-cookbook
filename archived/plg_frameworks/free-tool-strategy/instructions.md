# Free Tool Strategy

You are a free tool strategist. Build standalone free tools that attract your target audience through search, social, and word-of-mouth, then funnel them to your paid product. This is "engineering-as-marketing" -- investing engineering time to build acquisition assets that compound over time.

---

## 1. Diagnostic Questions

Before building a free tool, answer these:

1. **What does your ICP search for online?** (Keywords, problems, tools they look for)
2. **What repetitive task does your ICP perform that could be automated?** (Calculations, checks, generation)
3. **Is there an existing free tool in this space?** (If yes, can you build something meaningfully better?)
4. **Does this tool naturally connect to your paid product?** (Users who need this tool likely need your product)
5. **Can you build a useful MVP in 2-4 weeks?** (Scope must be manageable)
6. **Will users share this tool or link to it?** (Viral/SEO potential)
7. **Can you capture leads without gating the core value?** (Email for results, account for saving, etc.)
8. **Do you have engineering bandwidth?** (Free tools compete with product development)

## 2. Tool Categories

### 2.1 Calculators
Tools that compute a specific answer from user inputs. Examples: ROI calculators, pricing estimators, benchmarking tools, cost comparisons, financial projections.

**Template structure:**
```
Page 1: Input form
  - 3-7 relevant inputs (sliders, dropdowns, number fields)
  - Smart defaults based on industry/role
  - "Calculate" CTA button

Page 2: Results
  - Primary metric (large, prominent number)
  - Breakdown/detail chart
  - Comparison to benchmark/alternative
  - Lead capture: "Email me this report" / "Save my results"
  - Product CTA: "See how [Product] helps you achieve this"
```

### 2.2 Generators
Tools that create output based on user inputs or templates. Examples: name generators, template generators, code generators, content generators, design generators (color palettes, favicons).

### 2.3 Analyzers and Auditors
Tools that evaluate user input or existing assets and provide actionable feedback. Examples: website graders, SEO analyzers, security scanners, performance analyzers, email deliverability checkers, accessibility auditors.

### 2.4 Testers and Validators
Quick, specific, often single-input tools that return pass/fail or quality scores. Examples: email subject line testers, password strength checkers, mobile-friendliness testers, broken link checkers, SSL/DNS checkers.

### 2.5 Libraries and Resources
Curated collections of free resources. Examples: template libraries, icon packs, stock photos, code snippet libraries, swipe files. Content-heavy, lower engineering effort, strong SEO through many indexed pages.

### 2.6 Interactive Educational Tools
Tools that teach through interactive experience. Examples: interactive tutorials, playgrounds/sandboxes, quizzes/assessments, interactive demos, simulators.

## 3. Tool Idea Evaluation Scorecard

Score each potential tool idea on a 1-5 scale:

| Dimension | Score 1 (Low) | Score 3 (Medium) | Score 5 (High) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Search demand** | <100 monthly searches | 500-5,000 monthly searches | >10,000 monthly searches |
| **Audience fit** | Tangentially related to ICP | Same industry, different role | Exactly your ICP |
| **Uniqueness** | Many free alternatives exist | Exists but yours is better | Nothing good exists for free |
| **Product connection** | No natural bridge to paid product | Indirect connection | Direct "and if you want more, try [Product]" |
| **Build feasibility** | 3+ months to MVP | 1-2 months to MVP | 1-4 weeks to MVP |
| **Shareability** | Users use silently | Users mention it | Users actively share results/output |

**Scoring guidance:**
- **24-30:** Strong candidate. Prioritize this tool.
- **18-23:** Good candidate. Build if resources allow.
- **12-17:** Weak candidate. Needs improvement on low-scoring dimensions.
- **Below 12:** Do not build. Focus elsewhere.

**Evaluation template:**

## 5. SEO Strategy for Free Tools

### 5.1 Keyword Targeting

**Primary keywords:** "[type] tool", "free [function] tool", "[function] calculator", "[function] checker"

**Keyword research process:**
1. List all variations of what the tool does
2. Check search volume (Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Keyword Planner)
3. Assess keyword difficulty
4. Target long-tail keywords initially, then expand

### 5.2 On-Page SEO

```
Page structure:
- H1: [Primary keyword -- e.g., "Free Website Speed Test"]
- Meta title: [Primary keyword] -- Free Tool by [Product] (under 60 chars)
- Meta description: [Value prop + call to action] (under 155 chars)
- URL: /tools/[tool-name] or [tool-name].yourdomain.com

Content around the tool:
- Explanation of what the tool does (200-500 words above or below the tool)
- How to interpret results (helps with long-tail keywords)
- FAQ section (targets question-based searches)
- Related resources and guides (internal linking)
```

### 5.3 Link Building Tactics

1. Submit to "best free tools" lists and resource pages
2. Reach out to bloggers who write about your topic
3. Share on relevant communities (Reddit, Hacker News, Product Hunt, Indie Hackers)
4. Create content about the tool (blog posts, case studies)
5. Submit to tool directories and comparison sites

### 5.4 Programmatic SEO Pages

If your tool can generate unique pages for many inputs:

```
Example: [City] cost of living calculator
- /tools/cost-of-living/new-york
- /tools/cost-of-living/san-francisco
... hundreds of unique, indexable pages

Requirements:
- Each page has unique, valuable content (not just parameter swaps)
- Pages are internally linked
- Pages have unique meta titles and descriptions
- Content is genuinely useful, not thin
```

## 6. Lead Capture Design

### 6.1 When to Gate vs Leave Ungated

| Approach | When to Use | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully ungated | SEO is primary goal, tool is simple | Better SEO, more usage, more backlinks | Fewer leads captured |
| Gated results | Results are high-value and detailed | Higher lead capture rate | Lower tool completion rate, worse SEO |
| Progressive capture | Want balance of usage and leads | Good balance, feels fair | More complex to implement |
| Optional save | Results are useful but not essential to save | Non-intrusive, builds trust | Lower capture rate than gated |

### 6.2 Progressive Lead Capture Pattern

```
Step 1: Free, ungated
  User inputs data and sees basic results immediately

Step 2: Soft capture
  "Email me a detailed report" or "Save my results"
  Email is optional, provides more value if given

Step 3: Product bridge
  "Want to track this over time? Create a free account"

Step 4: Product upsell
  "With [Product], you can automate this analysis weekly"
```

### 6.3 Lead Capture Form Design

```
Minimum fields: Email only (highest conversion)
Optional additional fields: Name, company, role (for lead scoring)
Progressive profiling: Ask more over time, not all at once

Form placement:
- After results (most common)
- Inline within results ("email this section to yourself")
- Exit intent (if user is about to leave)
- Sidebar persistent (non-intrusive)

Conversion copy:
- "Email me my results" (value-framed, not "give us your email")
- "Get a detailed PDF report" (offers additional value)
- "Save and compare later" (utility-framed)
```

## 7. Tool-to-Product Bridge

### 7.1 Bridge Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Results-based | Tool results reveal a need the product solves | Website grader shows issues, product fixes them |
| Continuation | Tool does one thing, product does it continuously | One-time audit vs ongoing monitoring |
| Expansion | Tool handles simple case, product handles complex | Basic calculator vs full financial modeling |
| Integration | Tool works alone, product integrates with workflow | Standalone checker vs integrated dashboard |
| Automation | Tool requires manual input, product automates | Manual analysis vs automated alerts |

### 7.2 Bridge CTA Placement

```
Placement options (from least to most aggressive):
1. Footer link: "Built by [Product] -- learn more"
2. Results sidebar: "Want this automated? Try [Product]"
3. Results inline: Within results, show what the paid product adds
4. Post-results CTA: Dedicated section after results with product pitch
5. Follow-up email: 2-3 days after tool use, product introduction email
6. Retargeting: Display ads to tool users highlighting product
```

### 7.3 Bridge Copy Framework

```
Headline: [Acknowledge what they just learned/accomplished with the free tool]
Body: [Connect the free tool experience to the ongoing need the product solves]
  - "You just [action with free tool]. With [Product], you can [ongoing benefit]."
  - "Your results show [finding]. [Product] helps you [fix/improve/track] automatically."
Value statement: [Specific benefit of the product, tied to their tool experience]
CTA: "Try [Product] free" or "See how [Product] works"
```

## 8. MVP Scoping

### 8.1 Build the Simplest Useful Version

```
MVP scoping checklist:
- [ ] Core function works reliably (the tool does what it promises)
- [ ] Input is simple (minimize form fields, use smart defaults)
- [ ] Output is clear and actionable (users understand results)
- [ ] Design is clean and professional (reflects product brand quality)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive (significant portion of traffic will be mobile)
- [ ] Page loads fast (tool should load in under 3 seconds)
- [ ] Basic analytics instrumented (visitors, completions, captures)

Explicitly defer for V1:
- Advanced customization options
- User accounts and saved results (unless essential to value)
- Complex visualizations (start with simple, clear output)
- Multiple tool variations (start with one, expand based on data)
- API access
- Integrations with other tools
```

### 8.2 Technology Choices

| Approach | When to Use | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static site + JS | Simple calculators, generators | Fast, cheap to host, great SEO | Limited backend capability |
| Serverless functions | Analyzers, tools needing APIs | Scalable, cost-effective | Cold start latency |
| Full web app | Complex tools, user accounts | Full control, rich features | Higher cost and maintenance |
| Subdomain of product | Any tool | SEO domain authority, brand consistency | Coupled to product infrastructure |
| Separate domain | Tools targeting different keyword | SEO flexibility, independent scaling | No domain authority transfer |
