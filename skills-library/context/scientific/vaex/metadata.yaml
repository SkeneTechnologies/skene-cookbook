    job: Use this skill for processing and analyzing large tabular datasets (billions
      of rows) that exceed available RAM. Vaex excels at out-of-core DataFrame operations,
      lazy evaluation, fast aggregations, efficient visualization of big data, and
      machine learning on large datasets. Apply when users need to work with large
      CSV/HDF5/Arrow/Parquet files, perform fast statistics on massive datasets, create
      visualizations of big data, or build ML pipelines that do not fit in memory.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute vaex
