    job: Framework for computational fluid dynamics simulations using Python. Use
      when running fluid dynamics simulations including Navier-Stokes equations (2D/3D),
      shallow water equations, stratified flows, or when analyzing turbulence, vortex
      dynamics, or geophysical flows. Provides pseudospectral methods with FFT, HPC
      support, and comprehensive output analysis.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute fluidsim
