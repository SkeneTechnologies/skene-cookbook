    job: This skill should be used for time series machine learning tasks including
      classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, anomaly detection, segmentation,
      and similarity search. Use when working with temporal data, sequential patterns,
      or time-indexed observations requiring specialized algorithms beyond standard
      ML approaches. Particularly suited for univariate and multivariate time series
      analysis with scikit-learn compatible APIs.
    context: When working in scientific domain
