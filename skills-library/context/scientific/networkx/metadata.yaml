    job: Comprehensive toolkit for creating, analyzing, and visualizing complex networks
      and graphs in Python. Use when working with network/graph data structures, analyzing
      relationships between entities, computing graph algorithms (shortest paths,
      centrality, clustering), detecting communities, generating synthetic networks,
      or visualizing network topologies. Applicable to social networks, biological
      networks, transportation systems, citation networks, and any domain involving
      pairwise relationships.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute networkx
