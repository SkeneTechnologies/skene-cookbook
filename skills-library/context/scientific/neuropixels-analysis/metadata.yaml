    job: Neuropixels neural recording analysis. Load SpikeGLX/OpenEphys data, preprocess,
      motion correction, Kilosort4 spike sorting, quality metrics, Allen/IBL curation,
      AI-assisted visual analysis, for Neuropixels 1.0/2.0 extracellular electrophysiology.
      Use when working with neural recordings, spike sorting, extracellular electrophysiology,
      or when the user mentions Neuropixels, SpikeGLX, Open Ephys, Kilosort, quality
      metrics, or unit curation.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute neuropixels-analysis
