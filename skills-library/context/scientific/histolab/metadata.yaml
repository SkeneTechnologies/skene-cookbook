    job: Lightweight WSI tile extraction and preprocessing. Use for basic slide processing
      tissue detection, tile extraction, stain normalization for H&E images. Best
      for simple pipelines, dataset preparation, quick tile-based analysis. For advanced
      spatial proteomics, multiplexed imaging, or deep learning pipelines use pathml.
    context: When working in scientific domain
