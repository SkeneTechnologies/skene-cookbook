  jtbd:
    job: Fast in-memory DataFrame library for datasets that fit in RAM. Use when pandas
      is too slow but data still fits in memory. Lazy evaluation, parallel execution,
      Apache Arrow backend. Best for 1-100GB datasets, ETL pipelines, faster pandas
      replacement. For larger-than-RAM data use dask or vaex.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute polars
