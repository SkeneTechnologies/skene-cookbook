  jtbd:
    job: Google quantum computing framework. Use when targeting Google Quantum AI
      hardware, designing noise-aware circuits, or running quantum characterization
      experiments. Best for Google hardware, noise modeling, and low-level circuit
      design. For IBM hardware use qiskit; for quantum ML with autodiff use pennylane;
      for physics simulations use qutip.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute cirq
