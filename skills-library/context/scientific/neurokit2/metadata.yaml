    job: Comprehensive biosignal processing toolkit for analyzing physiological data
      including ECG, EEG, EDA, RSP, PPG, EMG, and EOG signals. Use this skill when
      processing cardiovascular signals, brain activity, electrodermal responses,
      respiratory patterns, muscle activity, or eye movements. Applicable for heart
      rate variability analysis, event-related potentials, complexity measures, autonomic
      nervous system assessment, psychophysiology research, and multi-modal physiological
      signal integration.
    context: When working in scientific domain
