    job: Spectral similarity and compound identification for metabolomics. Use for
      comparing mass spectra, computing similarity scores (cosine, modified cosine),
      and identifying unknown compounds from spectral libraries. Best for metabolite
      identification, spectral matching, library searching. For full LC-MS/MS proteomics
      pipelines use pyopenms.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute matchms
