    job: Generate professional clinical decision support (CDS) documents for pharmaceutical
      and clinical research settings, including patient cohort analyses (biomarker-stratified
      with outcomes) and treatment recommendation reports (evidence-based guidelines
      with decision algorithms). Supports GRADE evidence grading, statistical analysis
      (hazard ratios, survival curves, waterfall plots), biomarker integration, and
      regulatory compliance. Outputs publication-ready LaTeX/PDF format optimized
      for drug development, clinical research, and evidence synthesis.
    context: When working in scientific domain
