    job: Comprehensive Python library for astronomy and astrophysics. This skill should
      be used when working with astronomical data including celestial coordinates,
      physical units, FITS files, cosmological calculations, time systems, tables,
      world coordinate systems (WCS), and astronomical data analysis. Use when tasks
      involve coordinate transformations, unit conversions, FITS file manipulation,
      cosmological distance calculations, time scale conversions, or astronomical
      data processing.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute astropy
