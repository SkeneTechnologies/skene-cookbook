    job: Direct REST API access to KEGG (academic use only). Pathway analysis, gene-pathway
      mapping, metabolic pathways, drug interactions, ID conversion. For Python workflows
      with multiple databases, prefer bioservices. Use this for direct HTTP/REST work
      or KEGG-specific control.
    context: When working in scientific domain
