  jtbd:
    job: Unified Python interface to 40+ bioinformatics services. Use when querying
      multiple databases (UniProt, KEGG, ChEMBL, Reactome) in a single workflow with
      consistent API. Best for cross-database analysis, ID mapping across services.
      For quick single-database lookups use gget; for sequence/file manipulation use
      biopython.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute bioservices
