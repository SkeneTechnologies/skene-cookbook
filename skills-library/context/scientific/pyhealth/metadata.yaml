    job: Comprehensive healthcare AI toolkit for developing, testing, and deploying
      machine learning models with clinical data. This skill should be used when working
      with electronic health records (EHR), clinical prediction tasks (mortality,
      readmission, drug recommendation), medical coding systems (ICD, NDC, ATC), physiological
      signals (EEG, ECG), healthcare datasets (MIMIC-III/IV, eICU, OMOP), or implementing
      deep learning models for healthcare applications (RETAIN, SafeDrug, Transformer,
      GNN).
    context: When working in scientific domain
