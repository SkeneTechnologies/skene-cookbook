    job: Structured hypothesis formulation from observations. Use when you have experimental
      observations or data and need to formulate testable hypotheses with predictions,
      propose mechanisms, and design experiments to test them. Follows scientific
      method framework. For open-ended ideation use scientific-brainstorming; for
      automated LLM-driven hypothesis testing on datasets use hypogenic.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute hypothesis-generation
