    job: Full-featured computational pathology toolkit. Use for advanced WSI analysis
      including multiplexed immunofluorescence (CODEX, Vectra), nucleus segmentation,
      tissue graph construction, and ML model training on pathology data. Supports
      160+ slide formats. For simple tile extraction from H&E slides, histolab may
      be simpler.
