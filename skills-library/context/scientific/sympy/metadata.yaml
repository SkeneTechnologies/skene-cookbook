    job: Use this skill when working with symbolic mathematics in Python. This skill
      should be used for symbolic computation tasks including solving equations algebraically,
      performing calculus operations (derivatives, integrals, limits), manipulating
      algebraic expressions, working with matrices symbolically, physics calculations,
      number theory problems, geometry computations, and generating executable code
      from mathematical expressions. Apply this skill when the user needs exact symbolic
      results rather than numerical approximations, or when working with mathematical
      formulas that contain variables and parameters.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute sympy
