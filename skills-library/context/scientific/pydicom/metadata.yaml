    job: Python library for working with DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications
      in Medicine) files. Use this skill when reading, writing, or modifying medical
      imaging data in DICOM format, extracting pixel data from medical images (CT,
      MRI, X-ray, ultrasound), anonymizing DICOM files, working with DICOM metadata
      and tags, converting DICOM images to other formats, handling compressed DICOM
      data, or processing medical imaging datasets. Applies to tasks involving medical
      image analysis, PACS systems, radiology workflows, and healthcare imaging applications.
    context: When working in scientific domain
