    job: Comprehensive toolkit for survival analysis and time-to-event modeling in
      Python using scikit-survival. Use this skill when working with censored survival
      data, performing time-to-event analysis, fitting Cox models, Random Survival
      Forests, Gradient Boosting models, or Survival SVMs, evaluating survival predictions
      with concordance index or Brier score, handling competing risks, or implementing
      any survival analysis workflow with the scikit-survival library.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute scikit-survival
