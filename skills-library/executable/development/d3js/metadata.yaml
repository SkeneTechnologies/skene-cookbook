    job: Creating interactive data visualisations using d3.js. This skill should be
      used when creating custom charts, graphs, network diagrams, geographic visualisations,
      or any complex SVG-based data visualisation that requires fine-grained control
      over visual elements, transitions, or interactions. Use this for bespoke visualisations
      beyond standard charting libraries, whether in React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JavaScript,
      or any other environment.
    context: When working in development domain
    outcome: Successfully execute d3js
