    job: When the user needs mental models or frameworks for PLG decisions -- including
      product-channel fit, time-to-value, network effects, habit loops, or pricing
      psychology. Also use when the user asks "what framework should I use," "how
      should I think about this," or references a specific model like "adjacent user
      theory" or "bowling alley framework." For comprehensive PLG strategy, see plg-strategy.
      For growth loops, see growth-loops.
    context: When working in plg_frameworks domain
    outcome: Successfully execute plg-mental-models
