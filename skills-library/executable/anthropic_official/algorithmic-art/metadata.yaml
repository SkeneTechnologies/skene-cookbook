    job: Creating algorithmic art using p5.js with seeded randomness and interactive
      parameter exploration. Use this when users request creating art using code,
      generative art, algorithmic art, flow fields, or particle systems. Create original
      algorithmic art rather than copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright
      violations.
    context: When working in anthropic_official domain
    outcome: Successfully execute algorithmic-art
