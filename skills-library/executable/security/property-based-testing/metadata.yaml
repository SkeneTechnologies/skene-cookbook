    job: Provides guidance for property-based testing across multiple languages and
      smart contracts. Use when writing tests, reviewing code with serialization/validation/parsing
      patterns, designing features, or when property-based testing would provide stronger
      coverage than example-based tests.
    context: When working in security domain
    outcome: Successfully execute property-based-testing
