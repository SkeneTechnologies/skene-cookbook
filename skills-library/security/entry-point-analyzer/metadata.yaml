  jtbd:
    job: Analyzes smart contract codebases to identify state-changing entry points
      for security auditing. Detects externally callable functions that modify state,
      categorizes them by access level (public, admin, role-restricted, contract-only),
      and generates structured audit reports. Excludes view/pure/read-only functions.
      Use when auditing smart contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Solana/Rust, Move, TON,
      CosmWasm) or when asked to find entry points, audit flows, external functions,
      access control patterns, or privileged operations.
    context: When working in security domain
    outcome: Successfully execute entry-point-analyzer
