  jtbd:
    job: Pythonic wrapper around RDKit with simplified interface and sensible defaults.
      Preferred for standard drug discovery including SMILES parsing, standardization,
      descriptors, fingerprints, clustering, 3D conformers, parallel processing. Returns
      native rdkit.Chem.Mol objects. For advanced control or custom parameters, use
      rdkit directly.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute datamol
