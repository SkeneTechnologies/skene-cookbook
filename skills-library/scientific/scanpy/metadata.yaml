  jtbd:
    job: Standard single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline. Use for QC, normalization,
      dimensionality reduction (PCA/UMAP/t-SNE), clustering, differential expression,
      and visualization. Best for exploratory scRNA-seq analysis with established
      workflows. For deep learning models use scvi-tools; for data format questions
      use anndata.
    context: When working in scientific domain
