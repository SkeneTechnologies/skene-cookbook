    job: This skill should be used at the start of any computationally intensive scientific
      task to detect and report available system resources (CPU cores, GPUs, memory,
      disk space). It creates a JSON file with resource information and strategic
      recommendations that inform computational approach decisions such as whether
      to use parallel processing (joblib, multiprocessing), out-of-core computing
      (Dask, Zarr), GPU acceleration (PyTorch, JAX), or memory-efficient strategies.
      Use this skill before running analyses, training models, processing large datasets,
      or any task where resource constraints matter.
    context: When working in scientific domain
