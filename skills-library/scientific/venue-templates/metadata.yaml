    job: Access comprehensive LaTeX templates, formatting requirements, and submission
      guidelines for major scientific publication venues (Nature, Science, PLOS, IEEE,
      ACM), academic conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, CHI), research posters, and
      grant proposals (NSF, NIH, DOE, DARPA). This skill should be used when preparing
      manuscripts for journal submission, conference papers, research posters, or
      grant proposals and need venue-specific formatting requirements and templates.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute venue-templates
