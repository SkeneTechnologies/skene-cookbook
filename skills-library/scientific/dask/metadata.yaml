  jtbd:
    job: Distributed computing for larger-than-RAM pandas/NumPy workflows. Use when
      you need to scale existing pandas/NumPy code beyond memory or across clusters.
      Best for parallel file processing, distributed ML, integration with existing
      pandas code. For out-of-core analytics on single machine use vaex; for in-memory
      speed use polars.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute dask
