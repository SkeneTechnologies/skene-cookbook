    job: This skill should be used when working with genomic interval data (BED files)
      for machine learning tasks. Use for training region embeddings (Region2Vec,
      BEDspace), single-cell ATAC-seq analysis (scEmbed), building consensus peaks
      (universes), or any ML-based analysis of genomic regions. Applies to BED file
      collections, scATAC-seq data, chromatin accessibility datasets, and region-based
      genomic feature learning.
    context: When working in scientific domain
