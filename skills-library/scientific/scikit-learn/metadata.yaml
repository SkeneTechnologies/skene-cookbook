    job: Machine learning in Python with scikit-learn. Use when working with supervised
      learning (classification, regression), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
      reduction), model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, preprocessing, or building
      ML pipelines. Provides comprehensive reference documentation for algorithms,
      preprocessing techniques, pipelines, and best practices.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute scikit-learn
