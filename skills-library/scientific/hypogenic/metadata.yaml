    job: Automated LLM-driven hypothesis generation and testing on tabular datasets.
      Use when you want to systematically explore hypotheses about patterns in empirical
      data (e.g., deception detection, content analysis). Combines literature insights
      with data-driven hypothesis testing. For manual hypothesis formulation use hypothesis-generation;
      for creative ideation use scientific-brainstorming.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute hypogenic
