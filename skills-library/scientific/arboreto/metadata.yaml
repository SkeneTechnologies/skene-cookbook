    job: Infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data using scalable
      algorithms (GRNBoost2, GENIE3). Use when analyzing transcriptomics data (bulk
      RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq) to identify transcription factor-target gene relationships
      and regulatory interactions. Supports distributed computation for large-scale
      datasets.
