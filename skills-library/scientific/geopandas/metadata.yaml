    job: Python library for working with geospatial vector data including shapefiles,
      GeoJSON, and GeoPackage files. Use when working with geographic data for spatial
      analysis, geometric operations, coordinate transformations, spatial joins, overlay
      operations, choropleth mapping, or any task involving reading/writing/analyzing
      vector geographic data. Supports PostGIS databases, interactive maps, and integration
      with matplotlib/folium/cartopy. Use for tasks like buffer analysis, spatial
      joins between datasets, dissolving boundaries, clipping data, calculating areas/distances,
      reprojecting coordinate systems, creating maps, or converting between spatial
      file formats.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute geopandas
