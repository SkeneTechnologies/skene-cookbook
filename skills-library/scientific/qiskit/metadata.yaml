  jtbd:
    job: IBM quantum computing framework. Use when targeting IBM Quantum hardware,
      working with Qiskit Runtime for production workloads, or needing IBM optimization
      tools. Best for IBM hardware execution, quantum error mitigation, and enterprise
      quantum computing. For Google hardware use cirq; for gradient-based quantum
      ML use pennylane; for open quantum system simulations use qutip.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute qiskit
