    job: Direct REST API access to UniProt. Protein searches, FASTA retrieval, ID
      mapping, Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL. For Python workflows with multiple databases, prefer
      bioservices (unified interface to 40+ services). Use this for direct HTTP/REST
      work or UniProt-specific control.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute uniprot-database
