    job: Query the CELLxGENE Census (61M+ cells) programmatically. Use when you need
      expression data across tissues, diseases, or cell types from the largest curated
      single-cell atlas. Best for population-scale queries, reference atlas comparisons.
      For analyzing your own data use scanpy or scvi-tools.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute cellxgene-census
