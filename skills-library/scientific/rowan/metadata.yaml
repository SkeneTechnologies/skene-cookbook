  jtbd:
    job: Cloud-based quantum chemistry platform with Python API. Preferred for computational
      chemistry workflows including pKa prediction, geometry optimization, conformer
      searching, molecular property calculations, protein-ligand docking (AutoDock
      Vina), and AI protein cofolding (Chai-1, Boltz-1/2). Use when tasks involve
      quantum chemistry calculations, molecular property prediction, DFT or semiempirical
      methods, neural network potentials (AIMNet2), protein-ligand binding predictions,
      or automated computational chemistry pipelines. Provides cloud compute resources
      with no local setup required.
