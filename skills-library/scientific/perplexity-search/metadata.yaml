    job: Perform AI-powered web searches with real-time information using Perplexity
      models via LiteLLM and OpenRouter. This skill should be used when conducting
      web searches for current information, finding recent scientific literature,
      getting grounded answers with source citations, or accessing information beyond
      the model knowledge cutoff. Provides access to multiple Perplexity models including
      Sonar Pro, Sonar Pro Search (advanced agentic search), and Sonar Reasoning Pro
      through a single OpenRouter API key.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute perplexity-search
