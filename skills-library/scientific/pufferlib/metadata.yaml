  jtbd:
    job: High-performance reinforcement learning framework optimized for speed and
      scale. Use when you need fast parallel training, vectorized environments, multi-agent
      systems, or integration with game environments (Atari, Procgen, NetHack). Achieves
      2-10x speedups over standard implementations. For quick prototyping or standard
      algorithm implementations with extensive documentation, use stable-baselines3
      instead.
