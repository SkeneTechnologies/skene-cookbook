    job: Complete mass spectrometry analysis platform. Use for proteomics workflows
      feature detection, peptide identification, protein quantification, and complex
      LC-MS/MS pipelines. Supports extensive file formats and algorithms. Best for
      proteomics, comprehensive MS data processing. For simple spectral comparison
      and metabolite ID use matchms.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute pyopenms
