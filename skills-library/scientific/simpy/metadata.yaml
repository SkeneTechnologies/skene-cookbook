    job: Process-based discrete-event simulation framework in Python. Use this skill
      when building simulations of systems with processes, queues, resources, and
      time-based events such as manufacturing systems, service operations, network
      traffic, logistics, or any system where entities interact with shared resources
      over time.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute simpy
