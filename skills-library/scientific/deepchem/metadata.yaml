  jtbd:
    job: Molecular ML with diverse featurizers and pre-built datasets. Use for property
      prediction (ADMET, toxicity) with traditional ML or GNNs when you want extensive
      featurization options and MoleculeNet benchmarks. Best for quick experiments
      with pre-trained models, diverse molecular representations. For graph-first
      PyTorch workflows use torchdrug; for benchmark datasets use pytdc.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute deepchem
