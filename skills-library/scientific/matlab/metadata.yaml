    job: MATLAB and GNU Octave numerical computing for matrix operations, data analysis,
      visualization, and scientific computing. Use when writing MATLAB/Octave scripts
      for linear algebra, signal processing, image processing, differential equations,
      optimization, statistics, or creating scientific visualizations. Also use when
      the user needs help with MATLAB syntax, functions, or wants to convert between
      MATLAB and Python code. Scripts can be executed with MATLAB or the open-source
      GNU Octave interpreter.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute matlab
