    job: This skill should be used when working with LaminDB, an open-source data
      framework for biology that makes data queryable, traceable, reproducible, and
      FAIR. Use when managing biological datasets (scRNA-seq, spatial, flow cytometry,
      etc.), tracking computational workflows, curating and validating data with biological
      ontologies, building data lakehouses, or ensuring data lineage and reproducibility
      in biological research. Covers data management, annotation, ontologies (genes,
      cell types, diseases, tissues), schema validation, integrations with workflow
      managers (Nextflow, Snakemake) and MLOps platforms (W&B, MLflow), and deployment
      strategies.
