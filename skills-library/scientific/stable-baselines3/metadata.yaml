  jtbd:
    job: Production-ready reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, TD3, DDPG,
      A2C) with scikit-learn-like API. Use for standard RL experiments, quick prototyping,
      and well-documented algorithm implementations. Best for single-agent RL with
      Gymnasium environments. For high-performance parallel training, multi-agent
      systems, or custom vectorized environments, use pufferlib instead.
