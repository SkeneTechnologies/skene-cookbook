    job: Multiagent AI system for scientific research assistance that automates research
      workflows from data analysis to publication. This skill should be used when
      generating research ideas from datasets, developing research methodologies,
      executing computational experiments, performing literature searches, or generating
      publication-ready papers in LaTeX format. Supports end-to-end research pipelines
      with customizable agent orchestration.
    context: When working in scientific domain
