  jtbd:
    job: Hardware-agnostic quantum ML framework with automatic differentiation. Use
      when training quantum circuits via gradients, building hybrid quantum-classical
      models, or needing device portability across IBM/Google/Rigetti/IonQ. Best for
      variational algorithms (VQE, QAOA), quantum neural networks, and integration
      with PyTorch/JAX/TensorFlow. For hardware-specific optimizations use qiskit
      (IBM) or cirq (Google); for open quantum systems use qutip.
    context: When working in scientific domain
