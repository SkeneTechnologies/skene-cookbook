    job: Cheminformatics toolkit for fine-grained molecular control. SMILES/SDF parsing,
      descriptors (MW, LogP, TPSA), fingerprints, substructure search, 2D/3D generation,
      similarity, reactions. For standard workflows with simpler interface, use datamol
      (wrapper around RDKit). Use rdkit for advanced control, custom sanitization,
      specialized algorithms.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute rdkit
