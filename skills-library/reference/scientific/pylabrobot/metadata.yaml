  jtbd:
    job: Vendor-agnostic lab automation framework. Use when controlling multiple equipment
      types (Hamilton, Tecan, Opentrons, plate readers, pumps) or needing unified
      programming across different vendors. Best for complex workflows, multi-vendor
      setups, simulation. For Opentrons-only protocols with official API, opentrons-integration
      may be simpler.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute pylabrobot
