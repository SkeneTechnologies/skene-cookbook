    job: Comprehensive toolkit for protein language models including ESM3 (generative
      multimodal protein design across sequence, structure, and function) and ESM
      C (efficient protein embeddings and representations). Use this skill when working
      with protein sequences, structures, or function prediction; designing novel
      proteins; generating protein embeddings; performing inverse folding; or conducting
      protein engineering tasks. Supports both local model usage and cloud-based Forge
      API for scalable inference.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute esm
