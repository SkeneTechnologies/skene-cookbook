    job: Deep generative models for single-cell omics. Use when you need probabilistic
      batch correction (scVI), transfer learning, differential expression with uncertainty,
      or multi-modal integration (TOTALVI, MultiVI). Best for advanced modeling, batch
      effects, multimodal data. For standard analysis pipelines use scanpy.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute scvi-tools
