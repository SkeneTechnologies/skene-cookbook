    job: Cloud laboratory platform for automated protein testing and validation. Use
      when designing proteins and needing experimental validation including binding
      assays, expression testing, thermostability measurements, enzyme activity assays,
      or protein sequence optimization. Also use for submitting experiments via API,
      tracking experiment status, downloading results, optimizing protein sequences
      for better expression using computational tools (NetSolP, SoluProt, SolubleMPNN,
      ESM), or managing protein design workflows with wet-lab validation.
    context: When working in scientific domain
    outcome: Successfully execute adaptyv
