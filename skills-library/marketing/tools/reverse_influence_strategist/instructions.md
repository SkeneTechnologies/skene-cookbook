- Creating bottom-up marketing strategies
- Applying network theory to marketing problems

## Source Material

Read `Theory/reverse-influence-marketing.md` for detailed frameworks.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Multi-Step Flow of Communication

**Original Theory:** Lazarsfeld & Katz (1955)
- Mass Media → Opinion Leaders → The Public

**Inverted Application:**
- When "The Public" (followers) adopt something, they signal upward
- Influencers are "filters" — they adopt what their tribe validates
- **Key insight:** Don't pitch the leader. Pitch the tribe. The leader follows.

**Tactics:**
1. Identify the influencer's most engaged followers
2. Create content that resonates with the tribe
3. Get tribe members to organically mention your tool
4. Let the signal flow upward to the influencer

**Measurement:**
- Comments from tribe members
- Organic mentions in influencer's replies
- Tribe-to-leader amplification ratio

### 2. Structural Holes Theory

**Original Theory:** Ronald Burt (1992)
- Social networks have "holes" — gaps between groups that don't communicate

**Application:**
- Identify what the influencer's community needs but doesn't have
- Fill that gap with your tool/content
- Become the "bridge" they must cross

**Key insight:** You're not trying to be the "Star" (influencer). You're trying to be the "Bridge" (infrastructure).

**Tactics:**
1. Map the influencer's community's unmet needs
2. Create something that fills a structural hole
3. Make it indispensable for the community
4. The influencer must acknowledge what their community relies on

**Example:**
- Influencer community: Next.js developers
- Structural hole: No easy PLG tooling for indie hackers
- Bridge: skene-growth provides this missing infrastructure
- Influencer must eventually reference what their community uses

### 3. Surround Sound Marketing

**Concept:** Be "ubiquitous but invisible"
- Place your message in ALL channels the influencer consumes
- Don't shout directly — create ambient presence
- Trigger the "Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon" (Frequency Illusion)

**Application:**
1. Map the influencer's information diet (podcasts, newsletters, Reddit, X)
2. Place content in each channel
3. Create the sense that you're "everywhere"
4. Influencer begins to believe you're bigger than you are

**Tactics:**
| Channel | Tactic |
|---------|--------|
| Podcasts | Get mentioned by guests, not hosts |
| Newsletters | Contribute value, get cited |
| Reddit | Answer questions with relevant references |
| X | Be visible in their replies |
| LinkedIn | Appear in mutual connections' feeds |

### 4. Consensus Buying

**Theory:** Gartner research on B2B purchasing
- In complex decisions, mid-level adopters demand → leadership approves
- The CEO (influencer) signs off when the team (followers) unanimously requests

**Application:**
- Treat the influencer as the CEO
- Treat their followers as the team
- When followers all demand your product, the influencer must pay attention

**Tactics:**
1. Target developers who follow the influencer
2. Get them to try and publicly use the product
3. Create visible adoption in the influencer's feed
4. The influencer faces social pressure to acknowledge

## Strategy Templates

### Template 1: Bottom-Up Influencer Campaign

**Goal:** Get [Influencer] to acknowledge/share our product

**Phase 1: Tribe Mapping (Week 1)**
```
1. Identify influencer's top 50 engaged followers
2. Categorize by:
   - Engagement level (replies, retweets)
   - Follower count (micro-influencers within tribe)
   - Relevance to our product
3. Create target list of tribe members
```

**Phase 2: Tribe Engagement (Weeks 2-3)**
```
1. Engage with tribe members' content (value-add comments)
2. Share relevant insights they'd appreciate
3. Create content that tribe members find valuable
4. Get 5-10 tribe members to try product
```

**Phase 3: Signal Generation (Weeks 3-4)**
```
1. Encourage satisfied tribe members to share
2. Ask for feedback in public (creates visibility)
3. Feature tribe members in content
4. Let organic mentions accumulate
```

**Phase 4: Influencer Notice (Weeks 4-5)**
```
1. Influencer sees product mentioned repeatedly
2. Direct outreach with social proof
3. Reference: "Your community has been finding this useful"
4. Provide personalized value (PLG report on their repo)
```

### Template 2: Structural Hole Strategy

**Goal:** Become indispensable infrastructure for a community

**Step 1: Identify the Hole**
```
- What does this community need that doesn't exist?
- What friction do they experience repeatedly?
- What would they build if they had time?
```

**Step 2: Fill the Hole**
```
- Build/position product as the solution
- Make it frictionless to adopt
- Ensure it's valuable standalone (not dependent on us)
```

**Step 3: Seed Adoption**
```
- Get early adopters in the community
- Encourage public usage (GitHub, tweets)
- Create artifacts the community references
```

**Step 4: Become the Bridge**
```
- Community members start depending on your tool
- New members are pointed to your tool
- Influencer must cross through you to serve community
```

### Template 3: Surround Sound Execution

**Goal:** Create perception of ubiquity

**Channel Map for [Influencer]:**
```
| Channel | Their Consumption | Our Play |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Podcasts they guest on | [List] | Get hosts to mention us |
| Newsletters they read | [List] | Contribute valuable content |
| Subreddits they lurk | [List] | Answer relevant questions |
| X accounts they follow | [List] | Be visible in feeds |
| Discord/Slack communities | [List] | Be helpful member |
```

**Execution:**
```
Week 1: Map all channels
Week 2-3: Begin seeding content in each channel
Week 4-6: Intensify presence
Week 7+: Maintain ambient visibility
```
