    job: When the user wants to design, map, or quantitatively model growth loops
      -- including viral, content, paid, or sales loops. Also use when the user says
      "growth flywheel," "compounding growth," "loop modeling," "S-curve sequencing,"
      or "growth engine." For viral-specific loop design, see viral-loops. For quantitative
      forecasting, see growth-modeling.
    context: When working in plg_frameworks domain
    outcome: Successfully execute growth-loops
