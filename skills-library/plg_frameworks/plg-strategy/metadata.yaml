    job: When the user wants to assess PLG readiness, design a product-led growth
      strategy, choose between freemium and free trial, evaluate PLG maturity, or
      plan a hybrid PLG + sales model. Also use when the user says "should we do PLG,"
      "PLG vs sales-led," "growth motions," "PLG audit," or "go-to-market strategy."
      For specific mental models, see plg-mental-models. For growth loop design, see
      growth-loops.
    context: When working in plg_frameworks domain
    outcome: Successfully execute plg-strategy
